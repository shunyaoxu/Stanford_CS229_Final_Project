## Solving Jigsaw Puzzle Using Supervised Learning Methods
### 1. Motivation
	The jigsaw puzzle is a famous intellectual game invented centuries ago for people to assemble a picture cut into fragments and shuffled by rearranging these pieces. Depending on the complexity of the pictures and the number of pieces (pixels) divided, jigsaw puzzles can have various difficulties. For human vision, the challenge is that the matching between the pixels and the template picture is time consuming, which is where the aid of computers comes into play. A myriad of machine learning methods has been proposed to solve the Jigsaw Puzzle. For instance, in [2], an unsupervised learning method of recovering an original image from its shuffled parts is developed using domain generalization, while [3] uses a neural network to predict the relative position as well as the shortest path to reassemble the puzzle. With reference to the work done by the predecessors, we are motivated to base our project on solving the jigsaw puzzles by applying machine learning techniques
